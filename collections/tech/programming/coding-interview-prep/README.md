## Coding Interview Prep:
Coding interviews are different from the day-to-day work. You won't be able to bring your fancy IDE, and you will be expected to come up with a solution with a limited amount of time.

They are designed to test your problem-solving skills, algorithmic knowledge, and coding skills under pressure. so it's important to have these skills sharp and ready.

I remember doing this mistake multiple times before, where I will be busy working with a company for few years and when I decide to look for a new job, I end up spending a lot of time preparing for it after embarrassing myself in a few interviews in front of some junior developers.

So moving forward i learned my lesson to have a minimal weekly practice to keep this skillset sharp and ready.

### The Basics: 
First thing first, you need to have a good understanding of the basics (Algorithm, and Data Structures).
I like to follow LeetCode Roadmap when studying these basics:

  * Bit Manipulation: https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/bit-manipulation/

### The Practice:
After mastering the basics, you need to start practicing. I really liked the idea of this [article](https://interviewnoodle.com/top-leetcode-patterns-for-faang-coding-interviews-bdbe8766534c) where it mentions focusing on the most common patterns that are used in coding interviews.

I found two resources that where helpful to practice these patterns:
* Grokking the coding interview Patterns in Python: https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-python
* A hand picked 200 problems from AlgoExpert: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions

<summary>Maintaining this knowledge:</summary>
To make maintenance easy:
* Block a time on your calendar to practice weekly
* Subscribe to a platform that has periodic contests to save yourself the time of searching for problems to solve.
  * LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/contest they have weekly and bi-weekly contests.
  * Advent of Code: https://adventofcode.com/ Every December has a series of puzzles increase in difficulty from day 1 to 25.
