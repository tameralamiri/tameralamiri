## Programming:

Coding is a craft that requires a lot of practice and patience. It's a skill that can be learned and improved over time.

I like to quote [Anthony Bourdain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bourdain) from his book **Kitchen Confidential** when he talked about cooking and think about it in the context of coding:

"Cooking is a craft, I like to think, and a good cook is a craftsman—not an artist. There's nothing wrong with that: the great cathedrals of Europe were built by craftsmen—though not designed by them. Practicing your craft in expert fashion is noble, honorable, and satisfying."

### Learning how to code:
There is multiple programming languages, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. a good programmer should be able to learn and adapt new languages as needed.

To learn quickly you should have strong fundamentals, and then familiarize yourself with the syntax and idioms of the language you are learning to implement these fundamentals.

### Web Development:
For web development, I'm aligned with the view of breaking down the frontend and backend into two separate concerns.
* **Frontend**: Where the focus is on Customer Delight: user experience, design, and interactivity.
* **Backend**: Where the focus is on Speed and Efficiency to handle the data, and business logic.
