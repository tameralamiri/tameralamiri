## Data Platforms:

Almost all modern applications are data-driven, which means they have a data platform supporting them. A data platform is a collection of tools and services that enable the full lifecycle of data management, from ingestion to consumption.

Building such platforms requires a lot of planning and alignment between different teams. I found this video [Architecture for flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLnlaWKkb4) very helpful when thinking through designing such complex systems.

### Data Platforms Components:
Data platforms can be broken down into four main components:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Collecting data from various sources and storing it in a data lake or data warehouse.
2. **Data Storage**: Storing data in a structured or unstructured format.
3. **Data Processing**: Transforming data into a usable format.
4. **Data Analysis**: Analyzing data to extract insights and provide values to clients to make informed decisions.

### Supporting Components:
Along side the main platform, there should be a supporting infrastructure to ensure the data is of high quality and secure. These components include:
1. **Data Governance**: Ensuring data quality, security, and compliance.
2. **Data Catalog**: Managing metadata and data lineage.
3. **Data Monitoring**: Monitoring data quality, performance, and usage.

### AI/ML Component:
In addition to the main platform, there should be a component that enables the use of AI/ML to extract insights from the data. This component includes:
1. **Machine Learning**: Applying statistical models to analyze data and make predictions.
2. **Data Science Platforms**: Providing tools and services for data scientists to analyze data.
3. **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)**: Applying DevOps principles to machine learning for model deployment and monitoring.
