### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technologist who likes to tinker with Data Platforms, AI/ML, IoT, Computer Vision, and Interactive Experiences.

Based in NYC & run my own consultancy **Tamer LLC** where I help early stage start-ups as a fractional systems architect.

## Contacts:
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamer-alamiri/) (Currently Deactivted)

## Updates:
* As of Nov 19th 2024, I disabled all my social media accounts including linkedin, so this github account is the only publicly available account where you can find me. Happy to chat with people and meet IRL. Reach out to me via email and we will figure out something.

Cheers,
Tamer
