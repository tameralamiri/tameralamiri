### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technologist who likes to tinker with Data Platforms, AI/ML, IoT, Computer Vision, and Interactive Experiences.

Based in NYC & run my own consultancy **Tamer LLC** where I help early stage start-ups as a fractional systems architect.

## Contacts:
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamer-alamiri/) (Currently Deactivted)
* All Types of Email: <email@tamer.io> (Hosted by Protonmail)

## Updates:
* As of Nov 19th 2024, I disabled all my social media accounts including linkedin, so this github account is the only publicly available account where you can find me. Still happy to chat with people and meet IRL, reach out to my email to figure out something.
